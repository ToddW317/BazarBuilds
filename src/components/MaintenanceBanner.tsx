          Due to a bad actor in the community, The site has now been extremely restricted and will become 
          a static placeholder for now until I can restore cloud functions again and introduce LIGHT ad placement 
          to offset the cost of running a bigger scale website. I apologize for my oversight in this matter 
          and will do better in the future. Stay tuned for an awesome update! -TwoPercent
